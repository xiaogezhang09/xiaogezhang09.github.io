I am a Master's student at [VR Lab](http://vr.ict.ac.cn/), at the [Institue of Computing Technology](http://english.ict.cas.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/). Prior to that, I graduated from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) with a bachlor's degree in Remote Sensing, and majored in Photogrammetry. 
My interests lie in 3d reconstruction from multi-view stereo, self-supervised image inpainting.

**Depth completion**

**Confidence prediction for Multi-view Stereo**

In this work, we propose a Geometry-consistent Confidence prediction Network (GeoConfNet), where the correctness of a depth hypothesis is accurately predicted via a deep neural network that explores both spatial coherence and cross-view consistency. The proposed deep network consists of a feature extraction module, a U-Net-based fusion module and a confidence refinement module. Furthermore, we demonstrate that truncated signed distance field (TSDF) is a powerful cross-view feature which can be an effective complement to spatial features, thereby remarkably boosting confidence prediction accuracy of MVS.
