I am a Master student at VR Lab, at the Institue of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's in Remote Sensing in Wuhan University. 

My interests lie in 3d reconstruction from multi-view stereo, self-supervised image inpainting.

**Depth completion**

Coming soon

**Confidence prediction for MVS**

In this work, we propose a Geometry-consistent Confidence prediction Network (GeoConfNet), where the correctness of a depth hypothesis is accurately predicted via a deep neural network that explores both spatial coherence and cross-view consistency. The proposed deep network consists of a feature extraction module, a U-Net-based fusion module and a confidence refinement module. Furthermore, we demonstrate that truncated signed distance field (TSDF) is a powerful cross-view feature which can be an effective complement to spatial features, thereby remarkably boosting confidence prediction accuracy of MVS.

**Video Stabilization**

Following [Meshflow](http://www.liushuaicheng.org/eccv2016/) we implement an online and offline video stabilization system.
